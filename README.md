# row row fight the power(plant)

Adds REX from Risk of Rain 2. His moveset has been redesigned for 2D; he can now become temporarily immobile, allowing him to control a marker with his movement controls and call down sustained mortar strikes from any distance at the cost of his health and safety.

<!> Although Seed Barrage expends a lot of health in total and leaves you open to many ranged attacks, it has a very short cooldown, meaning you can enter and exit targeting mode quickly if necessary. 

<!> DIRECTIVE: Disperse creates distance between you and your enemies and debilitates them, setting them up for your other ranged skills. It can also destroy incoming projectiles, keeping you safe while you are immobilized.

<!> Tangling Growth has been reworked into an AOE attack with a short cooldown that briefly snares enemies and heals for a fraction of the damage dealt. If you can't afford to hunker down in the moment, this ability can keep you safe and recoup your health in a pinch.

His alternate abilities from Risk of Rain 2 have been redesigned in equal measure. DIRECTIVE: Impede covers the targeted area in weakening brambles, Noxious Bloom is a self-damaging dash that leaves behind a stunning explosive plant, and DIRECTIVE: Stimulate is a rework of DIRECTIVE: Harvest that generates a healing zone around the victim and grants a healing burst when the victim dies!
