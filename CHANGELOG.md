`v1.0.4`

Next update is going to include charge-able DISPERSE and (finally) the Scepter upgrade. I wanted to push this update first because it fixes a really important bug.

* Damage: 12+3 -> 10+2.8
* Regeneration reduced: 0.6+0.1 -> 0.5+0.15
* INJECT armor debuff -4, 6s -> -3, 4s
* INJECT lifesteal 30% -> 40%
* Mortar damage 350% -> 300%
* Growth lifesteal 25% -> 20%

- Mortar no longer fires twice in a single skill use when held down for long enough with multiple skill charges

*Thanks to ANXvariable for the assist.*

* Mortar no longer causes rendering issues with certain VFX

*For once I actually played a run to test this. REX should no longer cause any abrupt screen flashing or game crashes, sorry about that.*

`v1.0.3`
* Mortar radius reduced from 75 to 60
* Growth damage reduced from 150% to 50%
* Growth lifesteal increased from 15% to 25%
* Mortar can be canceled into itself, allowing for rapid fire
* DISPERSE can be canceled by climbing
* DISPERSE push force is more consistent (i think)
* DISPERSE can be used in quick succession to wavedash

*Thanks to ANXvariable for the assist.*

* Fixed Growth inconsistent pull strength (for the last time)

*Flower used to create a pull object for every enemy in its range, then each object would pull every enemy within its range towards it. Now it only pulls each enemy once.*

`v1.0.2`
* New Secondary: SATURATE 
    * Fires a barrage of stunning missiles at the targeted location
* INJECT damage reduced from 3x40% to 3x30%
* INJECT lifesteal reduced from 50% to 30%
* DISPERSE damage reduced from 50% to 30%
* DISPERSE lifesteal reduced from 75% to 60%
* Tangling Growth damage reduced from 8x150% to 8x120%

*Thinking about reducing REX's base damage stat to cut their damage output across the boatd. A thing I'm noticing is that the healing output is still a lot compared to your self-damage output.*

* Fixed Special not pulling harshly enough

Next up is probably going to be the Scepter upgrade, then after that the new sprites/visuals. I wanted to push this update out first because god dammit i broke the special AGAIN

`v1.0.1`
* Fixed God punishing you for clicking the Special button

`v1.0.0`
* Initial release
